            <h2>A critique from my client</h2>
            <p>I finished my website before the due date, but I am very sorry for the late submisson of my report. My client sent me the critique just before midnight April 12, I think it because the difference in time zone and my client(because he is in China) did not konw how many hours we have in difference. Below I transalated the critique of my client into english:</p>
            <p>Bennie can design this website for me according to my needs. Because I own a clothing store, Bennie put the new arriving clothes on the front page and divided the men and women sections, which is exactly what we need. My clothing store is licensed on other platforms, but we don't have our own website, so there is no favicon. At first, I didn't know what it was, but Bennie designed one for me according to my brand and put it on the website. I am very satisfied with most of the website. At present, the website is just a platform to show products. If there are more opportunities for cooperation in the future, I hope the website can be connected with our database. Bennie has been in active contact with me in the process of designing the website, and I also hope that she can learn more knowledge to improve this website.</p>
